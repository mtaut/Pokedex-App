This is a simple Pokémon pokedex app. Its purpose is to pull a list of Pokémon and Pokémon data from an external API to create a Pokedéx. Each Pokémon, when clicked, will load a modal containing the Pokémon's height, weight, types, and abilities. It will also show a front and back image of the Pokémon. 

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was used to create this app. The link to the external API being used: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150
